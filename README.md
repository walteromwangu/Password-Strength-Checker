Password Strength Checker
	This program checks the strength of a password entered by the user, according to the following criteria:
		-Password must be at least 8 characters long
		-Password must contain at least one digit
		-Password must contain at least one uppercase letter
		-Password must contain at least one lowercase letter
		-Password must contain at least one symbol

	The program uses regular expressions to match different types of characters in the password, and displays a message indicating whether the password is strong or not.

Usage
	To use the program, simply run the Python script (password_strength_checker.py).
	A graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear, with a text field to enter a password, a "Check" button to check the password, and an output label to display the result.
	Enter a password in the text field and click the "Check" button to check the strength of the password. The output label will display a message indicating whether the password is strong or not.
